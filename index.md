I am currently a Lecturer and the Director of Assessment in the Center for ESL at the University of Kentucky.

My specialties in applied linguistics are situated in two fields, language assessment and research methods.  In the first field, I am interested in research that involves examining the validity of the interpretations and uses of both high-stakes and low-stakes language tests. My research in this area has examined the use of small-sample test equating of placement tests developed by intensive English programs. In addition, my research has investigated applications of corpus linguistics as a method for collecting evidence for interpretive arguments. In the second field, I am interesting in applications of non-parametric analyses to small-sample data such as bootstrapping and the promotion and use of reproducible research tools within the R environment.

I received my PhD in Applied Linguistics from Northern Arizona University.
